# Use Case
<!-- Use Case (start) -->
As a Salesforce admin I want to migrate opportunities from one Salesforce organization to another.

This template serves as a foundation for setting an online sync of opportunities from one Salesforce instance to another. Every time there is new opportunity or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in Salesforce source instance and it will be responsible for updating the opportunity on the target org.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this template leverages the Mule batch module and [Outbound messaging](https://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/sforce_api_om_outboundmessaging.htm)
The batch job is divided in *Process* and *On Complete* stages.
The integration is triggered by a scheduler defined in the flow that is going to trigger the application, querying newest Salesforce updates/creations matching a filter criteria and executing the batch job.
During the *Process* stage, each Salesforce Opportunity is filtered depending on if it has an existing matching Opportunity in the Salesforce Org B.
The last step of the *Process* stage groups the Opportunities and create/update them in Salesforce Org B.

The integration could be also triggered by http inbound connector defined in the flow that is going to trigger the application and executing the batch job with received message from Salesforce source instance.
Outbound messaging in Salesforce allows you to specify that changes to fields within Salesforce can cause messages with field values to be sent to designated external servers.
Outbound messaging is part of the workflow rule functionality in Salesforce. Workflow rules watch for specific kinds of field changes and trigger automatic Salesforce actions in this case sending Opportunities as an outbound message to Mule HTTP Listener,
which further process this message and creates Opportunities in target Salesforce org.
Finally during the *On Complete* stage the template logs output statistics data into the console.

# Considerations
<!-- Default Considerations (start) -->

<!-- Default Considerations (end) -->

<!-- Considerations (start) -->
To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made for the template to run smoothly. **Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**
<!-- Considerations (end) -->



## Salesforce Considerations

Here's what you need to know about Salesforce to get this template to work:

- Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=checking_field_accessibility_for_a_particular_field.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field</a>.
- Can I modify the Field Access Settings? How? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=modifying_field_access_settings.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings</a>.

### As a Data Source

If the user who configured the template for the source system does not have at least *read only* permissions for the fields that are fetched, then an *InvalidFieldFault* API fault displays.

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: [InvalidFieldFault [ApiQueryFault 
[ApiFault  exceptionCode='INVALID_FIELD'
exceptionMessage='Account.Phone, Account.Rating, Account.RecordTypeId, 
Account.ShippingCity
^
ERROR at Row:1:Column:486
No such column 'RecordTypeId' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting to 
use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom field name. 
Reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'
]
row='1'
column='486'
]
]
```

### As a Data Destination

There are no considerations with using Salesforce as a data destination.

### Importing a Template into Studio
In Studio, click the Exchange X icon in the upper left of the taskbar, log in with your Anypoint Platform credentials, search for the template, and click Open.
<!-- Importing into Studio (start) -->

<!-- Importing into Studio (end) -->

### Running on Studio
After you import your template into Anypoint Studio, follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources.
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the "Properties to Configure" section.
+ Right click the template project folder.
+ Hover your mouse over `Run as`.
+ Click `Mule Application (configure)`.
+ Inside the dialog, select Environment and set the variable `mule.env` to the value `dev`.
+ Click `Run`.
<!-- Running on Studio (start) -->

<!-- Running on Studio (end) -->

### Running on Mule Standalone
Update the properties in one of the property files, for example in mule.prod.properties, and run your app with a corresponding environment variable. In this example, use `mule.env=prod`. 
After this, to trigger the use case you just need to browse to the local http endpoint with the port you configured in your file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should browse to: `http://localhost:9090/migrateOpportunities` and this will do the migration.

## Running on CloudHub
When creating your application in CloudHub, go to Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties to set the environment variables listed in "Properties to Configure" as well as the mule.env value.
<!-- Running on Cloudhub (start) -->
Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. Every time an Opportunity is created or modified, it will be automatically synchronized to Salesforce Org B.
<!-- Running on Cloudhub (end) -->

### Deploying a Template in CloudHub
In Studio, right click your project name in Package Explorer and select Anypoint Platform > Deploy on CloudHub.
<!-- Deploying on Cloudhub (start) -->

<!-- Deploying on Cloudhub (end) -->

## Properties to Configure
To use this template, configure properties such as credentials, configurations, etc.) in the properties file or in CloudHub from Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties. The sections that follow list example values.
### Application Configuration
<!-- Application Configuration (start) -->
**HTTP Connector Configuration**
+ http.port `9090` 

**Scheduler Configuration**
+ scheduler.frequency `60000`
+ scheduler.startDelay `0`

**Watermarking default last query timestamp e.g. 2017-12-13T03:00:59Z**
+ watermark.default.expression `2017-12-13T03:00:59Z`

**Batch Aggregator Configuration**
+ page.size `100`

**Trigger policy(push, poll)**
+ trigger.policy `push` | `poll`

**Account Sync Policy**
+ account.sync.policy `syncAccount`

**Note:** the property **account.sync.policy** can take any of the two following values: 

+ **empty_value**: if the propety has no value assigned to it then application will do nothing in what respect to the account and it'll just move the Opportunity over.
+ **syncAccount**: it will try to create the Opportunity's account if this is not pressent in the Salesforce instance B.

**Salesforce Connector configuration for company A**
+ sfdc.a.username `bob.dylan@orga`
+ sfdc.a.password `DylanPassword123`
+ sfdc.a.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`

**Salesforce Connector configuration for company B**
+ sfdc.b.username `joan.baez@orgb`
+ sfdc.b.password `JoanBaez456`
+ sfdc.b.securityToken `ces56arl7apQs56XTddf34X`
<!-- Application Configuration (end) -->

# API Calls
<!-- API Calls (start) -->
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + X + X / ${page.size}***

Being ***X*** the number of Opportunities to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***${page.size}*** is because, by default, Opportunities are gathered in groups of ${page.size} for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).

# Customize It!
This brief guide provides a high level understanding of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs. As Mule applications are based on XML files, this page describes the XML files used with this template. More files are available such as test classes and Mule application files, but to keep it simple, we focus on these XML files:

* config.xml
* businessLogic.xml
* endpoints.xml
* errorHandling.xml<!-- Customize it (start) -->

<!-- Customize it (end) -->

## config.xml
<!-- Default Config XML (start) -->
This file provides the configuration for connectors and configuration properties. Only change this file to make core changes to the connector processing logic. Otherwise, all parameters that can be modified should instead be in a properties file, which is the recommended place to make changes.<!-- Default Config XML (end) -->

<!-- Config XML (start) -->

<!-- Config XML (end) -->

## businessLogic.xml
<!-- Default Business Logic XML (start) -->
Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow that will poll for Salesforce creations/updates. The several message processors constitute high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Template:

1. During the *Process* stage, each Salesforce opportunity is filtered depending on if it has an existing matching opportunity in the Salesforce Org B.
2. The last step of the *Process* stage groups the opportunities and create/update them in Salesforce Org B.
3. Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Template logs output statistics data into the console.<!-- Default Business Logic XML (end) -->

<!-- Business Logic XML (start) -->

<!-- Business Logic XML (end) -->

## endpoints.xml
<!-- Default Endpoints XML (start) -->
This is file is conformed by three Flows.

The first one we'll call it **push** flow. This one contains an HTTP endpoint that will be listening for notifications from Salesforce . Each of them will be processed and thus update/create Opportunities, and then executing the batch job process.

The second one we'll call it **scheduler** flow. This one contains the Scheduler endpoint that will periodically trigger **sfdcQuery** flow and then executing the batch job process.

The third one we'll call it **sfdcQuery** flow. This one contains watermarking logic that will be querying Salesforce for updated/created Opportunities that meet the defined criteria in the query since the last polling. The last invocation timestamp is stored by using Objectstore Component and updated after each Salesforce query.

The property **trigger.policy** is the one in charge of defining from which endpoint the Template will receive the data. The property can only assume one of two values `push` or `poll`. Any other value will result in the Template ignoring all messages.<!-- Default Endpoints XML (end) -->

<!-- Endpoints XML (start) -->

## errorHandling.xml
<!-- Default Error Handling XML (start) -->
This file handles how your integration reacts depending on the different exceptions. This file provides error handling that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.<!-- Default Error Handling XML (end) -->
